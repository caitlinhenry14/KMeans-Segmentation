# K- Means Clustering Image Segmentation
This program reads an image and segments it by color using K-Means Clustering.
To execute the program, run 
`python3 segmentation.py K InputImageName OutputImageName`. I would play with the number of iterations, but it's quite slow right now, so I wouldn't try for anything too high.
